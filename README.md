See execution using demo video<br/>
•Digits are identified using hand gesture.<br/>
•It find region of interest, in which detect contours using skin color. <br/>
•Operations like noise removal, convex hull operations are performed. <br/>
•Number of figure is number of defects in convex hull plus one. <br/>
